Introduction
============

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems that I
have attempted in C.  I generally take a three-phase approach to each
problem, in which I first examine the problem on paper, then write a
naive solution, then optimize if possible.  The code shown here is the
final version of each solution.  For some problems, the commit history
will contain the naive and optimized versions of the solution.  However,
I typically optimize before committing to the repository.
